# Self-Checkout-Station
Worked with a group of 11 to develop the front and back end of a self-checkout machine.

The software component of the machine can be found in src/org/lsmr/SelfCheckoutSoftware. 
All tests are contained in SelfCheckoutSystem - Software - Test.
The hardware can be found in SelfCheckoutSystem - Hardware - v3.0. Note the hardware is written by Robert Walker.
